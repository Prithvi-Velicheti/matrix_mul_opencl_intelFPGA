# matrix_mul_opencl_intelFPGA
Hello every one
This is an Loop Tiling (loop nest optimization) based OpenCL Matrix Multiplication for one device(FPGA).
The code takes care of data path and CPU - FPGA communication.
It contains host code and kernel code and can be implemented on InteL FPGA of 
For compiling and running the kernel and host you need to INSTALL INTEL FPGA SDK for OPENCL.
